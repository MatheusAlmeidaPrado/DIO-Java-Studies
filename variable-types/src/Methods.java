    :: Method Recommendations ::
    Naming:
     * Must contain a verb (to indicate what that method will continously do);
     * Should follow the camelCase pattern (ex: countStars, findById , etc.);
    Consider:
     * Should the method be visible by the whole programm?
     * Will the method return any value?
     * Does the name makes it's objective/functionality clear?
     * Will the method need to intake any parameters to work with?
     * Could there be an exception that should be dealt with caution?
